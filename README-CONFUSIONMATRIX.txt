#READ ME FILE FOR LOGISTIC REGRESSION IMPLEMENTAION:
#SAVE THE FILE 'LOGISTIC-REGRESSION-IMPLEMENTATION-TEAM-SOHATO' ON YOUR PC 
#EXECUTE THE SCRIPT IN INCREASING ORDER AND SOME BASIC DISCRIPTION IS AS FOLLOWS
#THE CODE IS THROUGHLY COMMENTED 
#FOR FIRST TRIAL THE ENTIRE DATASET HAS TO BE READ WHICH WILL TAKE AROUND 20-25 MIN
#AFTER WE CONVERT TO CSR OUR CODE IS RUNNING VERY FAST AND MAKING PREDICTIONS REALLY QUICK DEPENDING UPON THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS.

#AFTER WHEN THE DATA IS PREPARED RUN THE FUNCTIONS IN FOLLOWING ORDER:
1.weights()
2.norml(mtx)
3.probX(W,sparse_mtx)
4.delta(y, unique_classes)
5.weight=training(sparse_mtx)
#weight WILL HAVE THE TRAINED WEIGHTS FROM THE TRAINING DATA.

6.testfunction WILL RETURN THE PREDICTED CLASSES IN coltest.
  # coltest=testfunction(sparse_test,weight)  
  # ADD 1 
7.RUN THE ACCURACY CELL FOR COMPUTING THE ACCUARCY 

8.AND CELLS BELOW TO SEE THE CONFUSION MATRIX.
 #CONFUSION_MATRIX = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test,y_predict )
  print(CONFUSION_MATRIX)
